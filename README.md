Forecasting with Time-Series to Image Encoding and Convolutional Neural Networks
Within forecasting there's an age old question, how useful and how relevant is my data and can I use it to make accurate predictions of what's going to happen in the future. For most of the previous and current century, this has been pretty constant. 
This however has been radically chaining thanks to the introduction of new technologies as well as Deep Learning. 

I was browsing through the when I stumbled on an  research paper called "Deep Learning and Time Series-to-Image Encoding for Financial Forecasting" written by a team consisting of both faculty and students from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Cagliari in Italy. 
In said paper they proposed a novel approach to Financial Forecasting. 

They proposed transforming time-series into images and using Convolutional Neural Networks to find pattern that might otherwise be overlooked by even the most seasoned analyst. 
The paper is fascinating highly recommend you to read it, however it does not contain any code nor the data source used on their research. And so curiosity got a hold of me, I decided to replicate their work from scratch.
